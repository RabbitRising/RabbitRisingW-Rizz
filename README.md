Project: Alchemy Shop (Working Title)

One-Line Pitch: A management sim where you run a magical alchemy shop, focused on stunning visuals and a simple, satisfying crafting loop.

Core Gameplay Loop:

    Acquire: Players will get ingredients by ______________ (e.g., foraging in a small daily backyard, ordering from a catalog, a magical goblin brings them).

    Craft: Players will combine ingredients at an alchemy station. Success creates a potion. Failure results in ______________ (e.g., a funny visual gag like a small explosion, turning the player's hands green for an hour).

    Sell: Customers will enter the shop with a request for a specific potion. Players fulfill the order for gold.

Key Features (The 'Rizz'):

    Visuals: Hyper-realistic, cinematic lighting and VFX in a single, detailed scene. The goal is to make every potion brew an eye-candy spectacle.

    My First 3 Potions:

        Potion of Healing

        Potion of Strength

        Potion of Charisma

    The "Unfair Advantage": This game will stand out because of its unparalleled visual fidelity for a solo-dev project
