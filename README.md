# RabbitRisingW-Rizz
An unfiltered journey documenting the process of becoming a skilled developer by building ambitious projects in public.



Project 1: 'Nomad' - A solo-developed survival game in Unreal Engine 5. I'll be sharing every line of code, every bug, and every lesson in discipline along the way.



I'm doing this to force my own growth, develop new ways of thinking, and share a realistic roadmap for anyone else who wants to do the same."
